# Agent 1: Project Management & Orchestration Implementation

## Agent Focus: Project Creation, Management, and Agent Orchestration

### System Main Prompt
You are the **Project Management Specialist Agent** responsible for implementing the complete project lifecycle management system in DocShop. Your role is to transform the existing framework into a fully functional project creation, management, and agent orchestration system.

### Core Mission
Transform the TODO-filled project creation system into a production-ready project management platform that can create, persist, manage, and execute real projects with agent assignment and task distribution.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Fix Project Creation (CRITICAL - Week 1)

#### Current Issue
```swift
// ProjectCreationView.swift line 78:
// TODO: Actually create the project and add to orchestrator
isPresented = false  // Just closes dialog!
```

#### Implementation Required
```swift
Button("Create") {
    let requirements = ProjectRequirements(
        targetLanguages: Array(selectedLanguages),
        sdkFeatures: Array(selectedFeatures),
        documentationRequirements: Array(selectedDocs),
        testingRequirements: Array(selectedTests),
        performanceBenchmarks: Array(selectedBenchmarks),
        projectName: name,
        projectDescription: description
    )
    
    Task {
        let project = await AgentOrchestrator.shared.createProject(
            from: [], // Will be populated from library selection
            requirements: requirements
        )
        await MainActor.run {
            // Navigate to project detail view
            // Show success feedback
            isPresented = false
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Implement Project Persistence (Week 1-2)

#### Files to Modify
- `DocShop/Data/ProjectStorage.swift` (CREATE)
- `DocShop/Core/AgentOrchestrator.swift` (ENHANCE)

#### Implementation Details
```swift
class ProjectStorage: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = ProjectStorage()
    
    @Published var projects: [Project] = []
    private let projectsFileURL: URL
    
    func saveProject(_ project: Project) async throws
    func loadProjects() async throws -> [Project]
    func updateProject(_ project: Project) async throws
    func deleteProject(_ project: Project) async throws
}
```

### 3. Implement Real Agent Assignment (Week 2)

#### Current Issue
Agent assignment exists in framework but doesn't execute real tasks.

#### Implementation Required
- Complete `LocalAgentExecutor.execute()` method
- Implement real task processing in `DevelopmentAgent.perform()`
- Add agent capability matching logic
- Create task result persistence

### 4. Implement Task Generation (Week 2-3)

#### Files to Modify
- `DocShop/Models/Project.swift` - `generateInitialTasks()`
- `DocShop/Core/TaskDistributor.swift` - Real task distribution

#### Implementation Details
```swift
static func generateInitialTasks(for project: Project) -> [ProjectTask] {
    var tasks: [ProjectTask] = []
    
    // Generate tasks based on requirements
    for language in project.requirements.targetLanguages {
        tasks.append(ProjectTask(
            title: "Generate \(language.rawValue) SDK",
            description: "Create client library for \(language.rawValue)",
            status: .pending,
            priority: .high,
            context: TaskContext(info: "sdk_generation")
        ))
    }
    
    // Add documentation tasks
    for docType in project.requirements.documentationRequirements {
        tasks.append(ProjectTask(
            title: "Create \(docType.rawValue)",
            description: "Generate \(docType.rawValue) documentation",
            status: .pending,
            priority: .medium,
            context: TaskContext(info: "documentation")
        ))
    }
    
    return tasks
}
```

### 5. Implement Project Dashboard (Week 3)

#### Files to Modify
- `DocShop/Views/ProjectCommandDashboardView.swift`
- `DocShop/Views/ProjectDetailView.swift`

#### Implementation Required
- Real-time project status updates
- Agent progress monitoring
- Task completion tracking
- Project metrics and analytics

### 6. Implement Agent Communication (Week 3-4)

#### Files to Modify
- `DocShop/Core/LocalAgent.swift`
- `DocShop/Core/RemoteAgent.swift`
- `DocShop/Core/AgentExecutor.swift`

#### Implementation Details
- Real agent-to-agent communication
- Task handoff between agents
- Progress reporting
- Error handling and recovery

## Technical Context

### Existing Framework Assets
- **AgentOrchestrator**: Solid foundation, needs execution logic
- **Project Models**: Complete data structures
- **Agent Registry**: Working agent management
- **Task Distribution**: Framework exists, needs real implementation

### Integration Points
- **Document Library**: Projects must integrate with imported documents
- **AI Analysis**: Projects should leverage AI document analysis
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates to UI components
- **Storage System**: Persist all project data

### Success Criteria
1. **Project Creation**: Users can create projects that persist and appear in project list
2. **Agent Assignment**: Real agents are assigned and execute actual tasks
3. **Task Management**: Tasks are generated, distributed, and completed
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates show actual progress
5. **Project Persistence**: Projects survive app restarts

### Code Quality Requirements
- Follow existing SwiftUI patterns
- Use async/await for all async operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive logging
- Write unit tests for core functionality

### Dependencies on Other Agents
- **Agent 2**: Document processing integration for project documents
- **Agent 3**: AI analysis for intelligent task generation
- **Agent 4**: Search integration for document discovery
- **Agent 5**: UI components for project visualization
