# DocShop v3.0 - 4-Agent Work Tree Implementation Plan
## Foundation-First Enhancement Strategy

## Executive Summary

DocShop v3.0 represents an **evolutionary enhancement** of the existing robust DocShop foundation, integrating Gabriel's Neuroplastic Memory Core (NMC) as an intelligent overlay. This plan preserves all existing functionality while adding adaptive memory capabilities, natural language interaction, and project-specific intelligence.

**Core Philosophy**: Build on the solid foundation, don't rebuild it.
