## Agent Isolation Strategy

### 1. Workspace Isolation
Each agent has a dedicated workspace with:
- Independent development environment
- Isolated testing framework
- Dedicated documentation
- Agent-specific configuration

### 2. Shared Interfaces
All agents communicate through well-defined interfaces:
- Protocol definitions in `shared/protocols/`
- Data models in `shared/models/`
- Integration contracts in `coordination/integration-points/`

### 3. Async Coordination
Agents work asynchronously with coordination through:
- Task tracking system
- Integration checkpoints
- Shared state management
- Continuous integration pipeline

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup (Week 0)
1. Create agent workspaces
2. Define shared interfaces
3. Set up coordination mechanisms
4. Establish testing framework

### Phase 2: Parallel Development (Weeks 1-2)
1. Agents work independently in their workspaces
2. Regular integration checkpoints
3. Shared interface evolution
4. Cross-agent testing

### Phase 3: Integration (Week 3)
1. Agent 5 leads integration efforts
2. End-to-end testing
3. Performance optimization
4. Production deployment

## Communication Protocols

### Agent-to-Agent Communication
```swift
protocol AgentCommunication {
    func sendMessage(_ message: AgentMessage) async throws
    func receiveMessage(_ message: AgentMessage) async throws
    func requestData(_ request: DataRequest) async throws -> DataResponse
}
```

### Shared State Management
```swift
protocol SharedStateManager {
    func updateState<T>(_ key: StateKey, value: T) async throws
    func getState<T>(_ key: StateKey, type: T.Type) async throws -> T?
    func subscribeToChanges(_ key: StateKey, handler: @escaping (Any) -> Void)
}
```

## Integration Checkpoints

### Daily Standups
- Progress updates from each agent
- Blocker identification
- Interface changes discussion
- Integration planning

### Weekly Integration
- Cross-agent testing
- Interface validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation updates

### Milestone Reviews
- Feature completion validation
- Integration testing
- User acceptance testing
- Production readiness assessment
