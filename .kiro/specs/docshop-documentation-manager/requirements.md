# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DocShop is a native macOS application designed to revolutionize how developers, technical writers, and knowledge workers manage, process, and interact with technical documentation. It serves as an intelligent documentation management system that automatically organizes, indexes, and enhances technical content from multiple sources, creating a unified knowledge base with powerful search capabilities and AI-assisted insights.

The application is built with a modular architecture, where components like document library management, AI processing, project management, and user interface are designed to be independent yet seamlessly integrated. This approach ensures that each module can be developed, tested, and enhanced separately while maintaining cohesive functionality across the entire application. Future-proofing is a key consideration, with well-defined integration points and APIs to facilitate the addition of new modules and capabilities over time.
