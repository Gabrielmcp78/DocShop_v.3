# DocShop Documentation Manager Integration Points Analysis

## Current Architecture Overview

DocShop is a native macOS application built with Swift and SwiftUI that manages technical documentation. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### High-Level Architecture

The application is organized into the following layers:
1. **UI Layer**: SwiftUI views for user interaction
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Core processing and management components
3. **Data Layer**: Storage and retrieval mechanisms
4. **AI Services Layer**: AI-powered document analysis and enhancement

### Module Structure

The codebase is organized into the following modules:

1. **App Module**: Main application entry point and UI coordination
2. **Core Module**: Core business logic and document processing
3. **Data Module**: Data persistence and retrieval
4. **Models Module**: Shared data models and types
5. **Views Module**: UI components and screens
6. **API Module**: External API integrations and services

### Multi-Agent Architecture

The system implements a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents handle different aspects of document processing and management, coordinated by an `AgentOrchestrator`.

### Data Components

1. **DocumentStorage**
   - Handles file system operations for documents
   - Manages document versioning and checksums
   - Provides backup and recovery mechanisms

2. **DocLibraryIndex**
   - Maintains an index of all documents
   - Provides document search and filtering
   - Manages document metadata

### UI Components

1. **DocumentDetailView**
   - Displays document content and metadata
   - Provides document navigation and interaction
   - Supports document export and sharing

2. **LibraryView**
   - Displays the document library

   - Manages document selection and preview

3. **DocumentDropView**
   - Handles document import from URLs and files
   - Provides drag-and-drop functionality
   - Manages duplicate detection and resolution

## Data Models

### Core Data Models

1. **DocumentMetaData**
   - Contains metadata about a document
   - Includes source URL, title, tags, content type, etc.
   - Tracks access history and favorites

2. **IngestedDocument**
   - Represents a processed document in the system
   - Contains document type, URL, and basic metadata

3. **DocumentChunk**
   - Represents a segment of a document
   - Contains content, position, and type information
   - Used for search and navigation

4. **Project**
   - Represents a project with associated documents
   - Contains requirements, tasks, and benchmarks
   - Tracks project status and progress
