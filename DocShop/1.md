1. Full Cypher and Semantic Capability Integration
Cypher Query Support:
Expose a Cypher query interface in your app, allowing advanced users to run arbitrary queries against the Neo4j backend.
Use the Theo Swift driver or the Neo4j HTTP API for direct Cypher execution from iOS/macOS [Graph Gopher example].
Support all Cypher features: pattern matching, property filtering, graph projections, and advanced queries.
Semantic/Vector Search:
Integrate Neo4j’s vector index and semantic search features for AI-powered document and code retrieval [GenAI docs].
Store and query vector embeddings for document chunks, enabling similarity and context-aware search.
APOC and Plugins:
Enable and expose APOC procedures for advanced graph operations, data import/export, and utility functions.
Allow users to run APOC commands from the UI for power-user workflows.
2. Robust Server Status & Command View
Server Health Dashboard:
Implement a status panel that shows:
Neo4j server connection status (green/yellow/red).
Last successful sync/ingestion.
Current server version, uptime, and resource usage (via Cypher or HTTP API).
Error logs and recent failures.
Provide controls to:
Restart/reconnect to the Neo4j server.
Run health checks and diagnostics.
View and manage active sessions/connections.
Per-Document Status Indicator:
In the document list and detail views, show a status icon (green/yellow/red) for each document:
Green: Successfully ingested into Neo4j.
Yellow: Pending or in-progress.
Red: Failed to ingest.
If red, provide a “Retry Ingestion” button to attempt re-sending the document/chunks to Neo4j.
Store and update this status in your SwiftData/CoreData cache and sync with Neo4j on success.
3. Knowledge Graph View Integration
Graph Visualization:
Replace the blank Knowledge Graph view with a live, interactive visualization of your Neo4j database.
Use a Swift-based graph visualization library, or embed a web view with Neo4j Bloom or the Neo4j Browser for rich exploration.
Allow users to:
Explore nodes, relationships, and properties.
Run Cypher queries and see results visually.
Filter by document, tag, code example, etc.
Click on a node to open the corresponding document or chunk in the app.
Neo4j Desktop App Integration:
If running on macOS, provide a “Open in Neo4j Desktop” button to launch the Neo4j Desktop app and connect to the current database.
Use the Neo4j MCP server (available on your Docker MCP server) for advanced management and plugin support.
4. MCP Server and Plugin Support
Leverage the Neo4j MCP Server:
Use the MCP server’s API to manage Neo4j, run commands, and monitor status.
Integrate with available plugins (e.g., APOC, Graph Data Science, vector search) for advanced analytics and AI features.
Plugin Management:
Expose plugin status and controls in your app’s settings or status dashboard.
Allow enabling/disabling plugins and viewing their documentation.
